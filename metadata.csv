audio1|The two neighbouring countries also agreed to allow cross-border travel on compassionate grounds in the coming months.
audio2|The two ministers had a constructive discussion on the national vaccination
audio3|out plans that are under way in both countries and discussed how this could facilitate
audio4|The operational details of the Reciprocal Recognition of Vaccine Certificate, including the detailed requirements, health protocols, and application process involved for entry and exit into Malaysia and Singapore
audio5|The ministers also reviewed bilateral cooperation and looked forward to strengthening cooperation to stimulate recovery from the effects of the global pandemic
audio6|highlighted the importance of strengthening mutually beneficial cooperation in overcoming common challenges brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic
audio7|It had also failed to implement a system to document checks on diving equipment before they were used
audio8|Investigations further revealed that no standby diver was appointed in the case of an emergency
audio9|Should a diver encounter an emergency situation, such as loss of consciousness, it would not be picked up by the buddy diver immediately
audio10|Swabbing stations were set up at a hostel at the National University of Singapore on Tuesday morning after
audio11|University Town affected by the move have been told they would have to remain indoors until results are out.
audio12|A cordon has also been placed around the units from the rest of the hostel.
audio13|In a letter addressed to the affected students, seen by The Straits Times, NUS said the Health Ministry requires all residents in these apartments
audio14|Students have to proceed to the foyer to undergo the tests in allocated slots between noon and 4pm on Tuesday with their mobile phone
audio15|Your swab test result will be known in two to three days. After which, we will provide further guidance depending on the result of the swab test
audio16|Meanwhile, affected students were instructed to attend lessons online.
audio17|They can leave the hostel room briefly for essential activities like using the bathroom, doing laundry and accepting food orders.
audio18|They were also told to declare their temperature twice a day through an NUS online platform and avoid physical contact with others.
audio19|Students spoke to from North Tower said that most residents there are international and postgraduate students.
audio20|Most units have four bedrooms, a shared bathroom and a pantry area, they said.
audio21|While travelling back to the hostel, they are to wind down the windows of cars they are in and avoid taking public transport.
audio22|Staff and students were informed of the incident in separate circulars.
audio23|The university has had a wastewater surveillance programme in place at all its hostels since December seven last year
audio24|The swab test has to be performed swiftly to identify whether there are other residents who may be or had been infected with Covid-19
audio25|This is so that we can provide immediate medical care and support, while taking the necessary steps to cut the transmission of Covid-19
audio26|Please remain calm, comply with the precautionary measures outlined above, and do not spread unverified information
audio27|There were no community cases and no cases from migrant workers' dormitories.
audio28|The last local transmission here was reported on March twelve.
audio29|More details will be announced on Tuesday night.
audio30|All twelve cases were imported and tested positive after being placed on stay-home notices.
audio31|The Briton was here on a short-term visit pass to visit a family member.
audio32|The eleven other cases comprise a dependant's pass holder and two work pass holders who had come from Indiaa
audio33|six work permit holders who had travelled from Bangladesh and India
audio34|She dies right after giving birth to him
audio35|He is sent to the orphanage, where he and the other orphans are treated terribly and fed very little
audio36|When he turns nine, he is sent to the workhouse, where again he and the others are treated badly and practically starved
audio37|The other boys, unable to stand their hunger any longer, decide to draw straws to choose who will have to go up and ask for more food
audio38|Oliver loses. On the appointed day, after finishing his first serving of gruel, he goes up and asks for more
audio39|Oliver walks towards London. When he is close, he is so weak he can barely continue
audio40|The Dodger tells Oliver he can come with him to a place where a gentleman will give him a place to sleep and food
audio41|One Oliver follows, and the Dodger takes him to an apartment in London where he meets Fagin
audio42|the aforementioned gentleman, and Oliver is offered a place to stay
audio43|Oliver eventually learns that Fagin’s boys are all pickpockets and thieves
audio44|but not until he is wrongfully accused of their crime of stealing an old gentleman’s handkerchief
audio45|He is arrested, but the bookseller comes just in time to the court and says that he saw that Oliver did not do it
audio46|The gentleman whose handkerchief was taken, Mr. Brownlow, feels bad for Oliver, and takes him in.
audio47|Oliver is very happy with Mr. Brownlow, but Fagin and his co-conspirators are not happy to have lost Oliver
audio48|So one day, when Mr. Brownlow entrusts Oliver to return some books to the bookseller for him
audio49|Oliver is forced to go on a house-breaking excursion with the intimidating
audio50|and is extremely happy and grateful to be with such kind and generous people
audio51|Singapore is now home to one of the world's largest floating solar farms
audio52|This is roughly equivalent to the greenhouse gas emissions from more than nine hundred passenger vehicles a year.
audio53|Sustainable energy provider Sunseap Group on Tuesday said it took close to a year to set up the solar farm in sea water in the Strait of Johor
audio54|It involved a total of thirteen thousand panels, forty inverters and more than five thousand floats, spread over an area about  the size of seven football fields.
audio55|The peak system installation is expected to produce an estimated six million kilo watts hours of energy per year. 
audio56|In land-scarce Singapore, the success of such a a sea-based floating system could lead the way for more such projects to tap energy from the sun here and in the region.
audio57|The solar farm is equipped with electrical panels, control systems and a twenty two kilovolt transformer.
audio58|It is also a landing point for the subsea cable that transmits the generated power to the national grid
audio59|The floating system is designed to withstand changing weather conditions, keeping the platform and all of the operational equipment on board steady.
audio60|There is also an air-conditioned second deck that doubles up as a visitor centre and viewing gallery.
audio61|This is an important milestone for Sunseap as we believe that offshore space like the sea, reservoirs, lakes
audio62|offers exciting opportunities for land-scarce and densely populated cities to tap solar energy
audio63|They are places that are unobscured from the sun and with low risks of vandalism or theft.
audio64|The project was more challenging compared with other land-based or rooftop installations due to the unpredictable nature of the open sea
audio65|the need to avoid shipping routes and the presence of barnacles, Sunseap said.
audio66|Marine expertise was also required for mooring installation and system design.
audio67|The Covid-19 lockdown last year posed an additional challenge as foreign workers hired by Sunseap's contractor were unable to leave their dormitories.
audio68|I am so thankful to many members of our team who rolled up their sleeves to fill in the gap during this period
audio69|Their professionalism and esprit de corps were key to the successful completion of the project in the face of the numerous challenges
audio70|A key part of protecting the planet from global warming involves shifting from the use of fossil fuels to renewable energy.
audio71|Three men are assisting with investigations, including an individual who is also being probed by police for allegedly possessing several scheduled weapons in his home
audio72|officers on the same day raided the Serangoon North home of the third suspect, who is said to be involved in the peddling of the e-vaporisers
audio73|E-vaporisers, which simulate smoking, are non-combustible. Each consists of an atomiser, a battery source and a small container for e-liquid or juice.
audio74|The rail industry here is seeking to reduce chances of miscommunication and get all stakeholders on the same page
audio75|The first three areas were launched on Tuesday by Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung at the Shangri-la hotel, part of a planned fuller set of expectations and fixed terminology.
audio76|The three areas cover terminology and abbreviations for the permanent way, or the rails that trains run on; how these rails are maintained
audio77|and the terms of references related to managing rail assets.
audio78|The standards are being worked on by seventeen working groups under a technical committee on railway systems set up last year.
audio79|Comprising academics, engineers and representatives from both SBS Transit and SMRT
audio80|it is an industry initiative in which the Land Transport Authority has played a relatively small role
audio81|He noted in an off-the-cuff speech he gave at the event that the standards should be pitched at a level where operations are not made too inflexible.
audio82|president of the Institution of Engineers and the co-chair of the technical committee
audio83|said the rail industry will benefit in three ways from standardisation.
audio84|It will be more consistent and interoperable, those working in the industry will be more competent with what is expected of them firmly laid out
audio85|Ultimately, these standards will act as benchmarks for the regional and international rail industry
audio86|enabling Singapore to strengthen its leadership position in the global rail transport sector
audio87|To mark the occasion, a commemorative book titled The Learning Journey Of The Singapore Railway Standards was launched by the Institution of Engineers
audio88|We hope that today's progress will pave the way for standards development in other sectors of land transportation
audio89|The four main areas the standards will eventually cover are asset management, maintenance, safety and security, and service.
audio90|Good practices like focusing more on employees' well-being, increasing work flexibility and adopting technologies to streamline operations can help banks and financial institutions prepare for the next pandemic
audio91|commissioned as part of an ongoing collaboration between the Monetary Authority of Singapore
audio92|The workplace redesign strategies presented in the study - which involved five months of research
audio93|The study, which covers areas such as the future of work and crowd management
audio94|While it is not intended to be a set of policy guidelines
audio95|it is a set of best practices for banks to future-proof their workplaces to ensure the safety of our customers and staff as well as to ensure the continuity of our operations
audio96|One suggestion involves integrating essential safe management measures into the future workplace
audio97|from maintaining safe distancing markers in public areas to having allocated restrooms for different teams.
audio98|Another recommendation is to create a business resilience plan
audio99|which includes allowing employees who can work remotely to do so and having up skilling programmes that produce more versatile workers.
